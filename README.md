## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
Due to Covid19 that occurred since December 2019, a significant proportion of the world including Singapore have been changing the way they lived.  Working from home, minimizing the interaction with people by keeping a safe distance and home-dining has become the norm. With people spending more time cooking at home, there has been an increased demand on cooking recipe and instructions.  

Our team proposed SnapYummy, an Intelligent Cooking Assistant that can detect the ingredients available in the refrigerator, and then present to users all the available recipes that are suitable for users to cook, and according to their preferences. It interacts with users via Telegram, a widely used Messaging Platform, and shows the recipe images, instructions, ingredients, and cooking time for users as references. 

The use of YOLOv5 for object detection and Neo4j knowledge graph for searching data are few of the key highlights of our Intelligent Cooking Assistant. With the YOLOv5 technology and Neo4j Knowledge Graph incorporated, it can recognize multiple food items in the refrigerator and search for the recipes in a faster manner. Besides, Intelligent Cooking Assistant also include DialogFlow for users’ intent detection. This allows our users to save time and focus on the cooking, instead of the preparation work like input the available ingredients or visiting recipe websites for searching cooking instructions.  

This Intelligent Cooking Assistant is targeting on users who need to: 

 - Use up most of the food items or leftover ingredients in the refrigerator, 

 - Plan for meal according to different preferences like cuisine type or dietary preferences, 

 - Learn or improve cooking skills,  

 - Spending less time in meal preparation and save time in the kitchen, 

Come out with new recipe ideas, new inspiration of cooking and eating. 

To date, our Intelligent Cooking Assistant are based on the recipes shared by community. In the future, we are looking to collaborate with famous cooking chef to come out with secret recipe. Users who have subscribed to premium service shall be able to subscribe to secret recipe from famous cooking chef.
